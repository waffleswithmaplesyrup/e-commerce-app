Welcome to Lazapee, your one-stop destination for online shopping! I mixed two beloved e-commerce sites Lazada and Shopee and created Lazapee! This e-commerce app is my first attempt at building a full-stack application using all the tools and skills acquired on unit 2.

## Design Process

The design of Lazapee focuses on delivering a user-friendly and visually appealing interface. I have carefully designed the layout, color scheme, and user interactions to ensure an enjoyable shopping experience for customers.

Using [Trello](https://trello.com/), I created a workspace where I ask myself questions customers would have when online shopping. Click [here](https://trello.com/invite/b/bKQ7vyz5/ATTIc2a0979fff69b62c8b038dd70041759eA36DCB75/lazapee) to view my Trello workspace.

I used a [dummy json products API](https://dummyjson.com/docs/products) to fetch products data to be used for this project as placeholders for actual products.

[Airtable](https://airtable.com/app7Fu8VNb6BUxYbM/shrLZKoiHXa50KsZ3/tblgaXfFbIsHV63Hq) was used to store data of the products added into shopping cart. This is where manipulation of the data such as PATCHing, POSTing, and DELETEing was done.
